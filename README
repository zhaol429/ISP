Inertially Stabilized Platform control based on Sliding Mode Control

In this paper, a finite-time robust controller is designed based on 
the terminal sliding mode for a two-axis gimbal ISP system. It is 
shown that the controller designed in this paper can not only ensure 
the system output tracking error converge to zero in a finite time, 
but also provide a strong disturbance rejection performance. 
In addition, the gain of the finite-time robust controller can be 
significantly reduced with respect to the ones of linear sliding mode
control schemes as well as PID control methods. Simulation results 
will also be provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed 
controller.
